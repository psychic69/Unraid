Replace Hard Drive – v6

Note: The data disks in SnapRaid’s config file must point to the drives PoolPart.xx folder and not to the root of the drive for the purposes of this tutorial and best SnapRaid / DrivePool integration.
Example: disk d1 c:\mount\disk1\PoolPart.xxx…………..

Shutdown computer (if drives are hot-swappable, just replace drive and skip to step #3)
Replace hard drive and restart computer
Drive to be replaced should be grayed out in Drivepool. Click on “Remove” (operation should be fast as Drivepool assumes drive is missing)
Stop Drivepool service
In Disk Management, format and rename new drive to same name as old drive and mount the drive in the storage folder
Run Snapraid fix command
• snapraid -d NAME -l fix.log fix (-l fix.log is optional)
example: snapraid -d dx fix (where x is the drive number in the config file)
The drive should be recreated exactly as it was except with no parity data or content file
Start Drivepool service and add the new drive to the pool
Go to newly re-created drive, move all of the drives folders/files into the PoolPart.xxx folder
Stop the Drivepool service
Edit the Snapraid config file, copy & paste the new PoolPart.xxx folder name into the path for the rebuilt drive
• Example: disk d1 c:\mount\disk1\PoolPart.xxx.old folder
change to:
disk d1 c:\mount\disk1\PoolPart.yyy.new folder
Run Snapraid check command
• snapraid -d NAME -a check
Example: snapraid -d dx –a check (where x is the drive number in the config file)
Run Snapraid sync command
• snapraid sync (or use sync.bat file)
Restart Drivepool service
Done!
